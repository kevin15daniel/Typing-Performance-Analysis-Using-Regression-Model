# Load the trained model
model = joblib.load('typing_performance_model.pkl')

# Example input data (features)
input_data = [[49.19, 92.28, 56.19, 77.38]]

# Predict typing performance metrics
prediction = model.predict(input_data)

print("Predicted Typing Performance Metrics:", prediction)
```

This will return the predicted typing performance metrics for the given input data.
